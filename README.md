# README #

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.

### What is this repository for? ###




### How do I get set up? ###

* Copy api.json.default to api.json - and edit api.json to match your info

* From terminal, run: python3 ApiTerm.py - This will alert you of missing dependencies. Please note these down so we can write an installation file in the future.

* Will probably need to get device ID from POSTman


### Contribution guidelines ###

* Execution wrapper is in __main__.py

* Main Menu is stored in ApiTerm.py - I have temporarily abandoned this, although, it will be nice for things like 2fa resets, outage estimates, etc.


### Who do I talk to? ###

* You know who to talk to!
